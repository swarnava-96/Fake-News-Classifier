# Fake-News-Classifier
https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data#

In these notebooks, I have only implemented with the train dataset that is available on Kaggle as mentioned in the above link. For the test dataset we can also use similar approach as I have alredy done with the train data. 

 In Notebook--Fake News Classifier, I have used The Bag of Words model and MultinomialNB and Passive Aggressive Classifier Algorithm. I have used 'title' as my feature set.
 
 In Notebook--Fake News Classifier 2, I have used Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF) model and MultinomialNB and Passive Aggressive Classifier Algorithm. I have used 'text' as my feature set.
